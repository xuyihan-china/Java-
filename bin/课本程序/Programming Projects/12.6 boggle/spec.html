  <h2>Boggle </h2>
  <h2><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse143/04su/projects/p7/turnin.html">Turn in here</a><br>
  </h2>
Boggle is a word game a bit like Scrabble.&nbsp; Given a set of
letters, players find valid words among them.&nbsp; In our version,
only one
person at a time plays the game, racing against the clock to score as
many points as possible.&nbsp; Longer words earn more points than
shorter words.&nbsp; The letters come from a grid, and the
words have to be spelled by letters that are adjacent on the
grid.&nbsp; Consecutive letters can be adjacent horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally.&nbsp; A letter square can <b><font color="#990000">not</font></b> be used <strike>in more
than one</strike> <font color="#cc6600">more than once</font> in a
word.&nbsp; Full
rules for the commerical Parker Brothers game, along with
illustrations, can be found on a <a href="http://www.centralconnector.com/GAMES/boggle.html">Boggle web
site</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Some of the&nbsp; rules&nbsp; would be quite
difficult to implement (like the one allowing plurals of nouns), but
your game should do as good a job as is practical at sticking to the
rules as described.&nbsp; However, you don't need to attempt any part
of the
game that involves multiple players.<br>
<br>
The design of the game program has been divided into three parts or
"modules", a Model, and View, and a Controller.&nbsp; Each team of
students will implement one or more versions of each of the
modules.&nbsp; For added zest, a full game can be formed by mixing and
matching modules from different teams!&nbsp; Mostly this will happen in
the second week of the project, but the design has to be carefully
followed from the start to make it possible.&nbsp; There will be some
limitations on what you can do and how your classes are packaged to
make the Mix 'n Match possible.&nbsp; <br>
<h3>Your Task</h3>
Implement versions of each of the game modules.&nbsp; Each module is
defined by a particular Java interface.<br>
<br>
Implementations can be "shallow" or "deep".&nbsp; A shallow
implementation is somewhat better than a mere stub.&nbsp; The methods
in it return
reasonable values so that other modules can be tested with it, but
don't have to be fully functional or elaborate.&nbsp; A "deep"
implementation is a full, working version which may be quite
elaborate.&nbsp; During the first week you should implement shallow
versions of any two of the modules, and a deep version of the third
module.&nbsp; During the second week you should implement deep versions
of all modules, and will be able to revise your original deep module,
too.<br>
<br>
The final application should have View with a graphical user interface
in a
frame.&nbsp; The grid will show the letters available to form
words.&nbsp; The frame will show the game status information, such as
whether a game is currently in progress, how much time remains, the
score, etc.&nbsp; Information about the modules (authors, etc.) will be
available.<br>
<br>
Here are brief descriptions of the modules.&nbsp; More information can
be found by browsing the Java interfaces.&nbsp; Also, as the project
progresses, you will gradually see better how the pieces have to fit
together.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Controller</span> <font color="#990000">(BoggleController.java, located in package
boggle.controller, implements mvc143.IBoggleController)</font>: The
Controller
handles primary interaction with the system and the user.&nbsp; The
main method is part of the Controller.&nbsp; The Controller has
references to the other modules.&nbsp; It may get information from the
playerr (user) and pass it to the appropriate module.&nbsp; When the
program
starts, the Controller is in overall control of the session.&nbsp; A
user can play as many games as desired without restarting the
application.&nbsp; For each game, the Controller sets things in
motion.&nbsp; This includes tasks such as reinitializing the score,
making sure the game grid is renewed, starting a timer, etc.&nbsp; When
the time runs out, the Controller ends that game, but the session
remains active in case the user wants to play again.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Model </span><font color="#990000">(BoggleModel.java,
located in package boggle.model, implements mvc143.IBoggleModel and
mvc143.IBoggleWordsModel)</font>: The Model contains the
data which makes up the game.&nbsp; For&nbsp; example, the Model knows
what letters are on the grid and where.&nbsp; It can tell if a proposed
string is valid or invalid.&nbsp; Normally, the Model should do this
with reference to a "dictionary".&nbsp; The dictionary is a file or
other source of valid words.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Model also knows how
to assign a score to each word, based on various rules it knows.&nbsp;
Finally, the Model knows what the score of the game is at any given
time.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">View</span><font color="#990000">
(BoggleView.java located in package boggle.view, implements
mvc143.IBoggleView)</font>: The View is responsible
for displaying the game to the user.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, it
determines how the grid should look (color, size, placement,
etc).&nbsp; It
paints the letters on the grid but
does not determine what those letters should be.&nbsp; The View gets
information about the game from the Model <font color="#990000">via
the Controller</font>.&nbsp; The View might also
interact with the Controller when user interaction is required.&nbsp;
(In many applications, it is difficult to make a clean separation
between the View and the Controller.&nbsp; For Boggle, the interfaces
generally define which module is responsible for different aspects of
the game).<br>
<br>
<font color="#990000"><b>Module packaging</b>: To enable Mix and Match,
each module must squeezed into its own, single .java file.&nbsp; For
example, a deep View would include at least a BoggleView class
implementing IBoggleView, plus GUI components overriding JPanel or
other Swing components.&nbsp; <i>All </i>of the classes making up the
view must be included in the BoggleView.java.&nbsp; If you put your
classes in separate files, as has been our practice (and which is
ordinarily good practice!), the MixMatch tool will not be able to load
them. [As you probably remember, but may not have had to use before,
you can put as many classes as you wish in a single .java file.&nbsp;
They can either be end-to-end, or can be nested, according to the
design.&nbsp; However, only <i>one </i>can be marked "public".]<br>
</font><br>
<h3>Supplied files</h3>
There are <strike>three</strike> <font color="#990000">four </font>major
interfaces that must be implemented, <font color="#990000">two for the
Model</font> and one each for
the <strike>Model,</strike> View, and Controller.&nbsp; There will
other classes and
interfaces available eventually, mostly as examples or suggestions for
implementation.&nbsp; Some data files (like word lists) may be posted,
too.<br>
<br>
You will notice that the files, including some that you have to create,
are spread out over at least four packages.&nbsp; It will be quite
important to have each file in the proper package, as the Mix and Match
tool depends on that.<br>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b>Written reports</b></h3>
In addition to the programs, please prepare these materials:<br>
1. A written report along the usual lines, prepared by you and your
partner together.<br>
2. A diagram showing the relationships of all the <strike>classes </strike><font color="#990000">types (classes and interfaces)</font> used in the
project (whether your own code <font color="#990000">or</font>
supplied code, but NOT libraries this
time)<br>
3. A description of how your game differs (in the rules, etc, not in
how it looks) from the official version.<br>
4. Screen snapshots (specified later)<br>
5. A confidential, printed report, one per person, which describes the
extent and nature of your own contributions to the project (second week
only).<br>
<br>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
1. Think of a short nickname for your
team.&nbsp; This will be necessary for other teams to identify the
authors of the classes they are working with.<br>
2. Look at the Boggle web site.&nbsp; Play a couple of practice games
with your partner.&nbsp; You don't need elaborate equipment for
this.&nbsp; Just draw a square with letters on it.<br>
3. Browse through all of the supplied code.<br>
4. Write absolutely minimal stubs for all the modules.&nbsp; This will
help you
see how the parts should fit together.&nbsp; Once everything is
compiling and executing, expand a few of the stub methods slightly to
try to get something that feels like a game, even if much of it is
missing.&nbsp; For example, the initial view doesn't have to be
graphical.&nbsp; You could print all the information on the
console!&nbsp; The model might accept all words as valid, and might
keep the score at 0.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps initially, all the letters on
the grid would be the same, etc.<br>
5. Once you have reasonable shallow implementations for all the
modules, pick one to concentrate on for the first deep implementation.<br>
<br>
<h3>Second week activities and beyond</h3>
After the first turn-in has past,&nbsp; all of the modules will be
posted and available for mix and match testing with each another.&nbsp;
There will be a special tool to facilitate this (one of the reasons why
the set-up is complicated, and why we are keeping our fingers crossed
that nothing goes wrong).<br>
<br>
After the second turn in, each team will meet with a TA to demonstrate
the game in person.&nbsp; This demo will contribute heavily to the
project grading.&nbsp; There will be a sign-up for demo
appointments.&nbsp; Both partners must show up, on time, or the project
will not be graded.&nbsp; At the demo, each team will show its three
components running together, and will also have to show that any one of
their modules can run well with modules from any other teams.&nbsp;
More later about these appointments and how to prepare for them.<br>
<p>Turn in (by 8/5 at 9:00pm, one per team):<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shallow versions of two modules, and a deep version of the
third.&nbsp; The turn-in form will have separate areas to facilitate
this.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A short written report (not a full final report), stating
mainly what modules are being turned in, and giving any instructions
needed for running or interpreting the program.&nbsp; State briefly
how what is turned in now differs from what you plan to complete by the
end of the program.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Turn in (by 8/12 at 9:00pm, one per team):<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deep versions of all three modules (including the one which you
turned in as deep the week before -- it is fine to make a revised
version of it).&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>Turn in any paperwork (written reports, screen snapshots,
etc.)
in class on the day following the electronic turn-in.&nbsp; Include
three screen snapshots.&nbsp; One should show your program (all three
of your own modules) just after the program starts, before a game is in
program.&nbsp; One should show your program with a game in progress, at
a point where at least one word has been correctly selected. &nbsp; One
should show the same situation as just mentioned, but this time with
someone else's view (your Controller and Model).&nbsp; Make sure
your names are on each piece of paper and staple everything together
(except the individual reports, which should be handled separately and
folded for confidentiality).</li>
