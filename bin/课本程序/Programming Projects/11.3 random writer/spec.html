This nifty assignment is based on an idea advanced by Claude Shannon
in 1948 <a href="#shannon">[3]</a> and subsequently popularized by
A.K. Dewdney in his column in Scientific American in 1990 <a
href="#dewdney">[1]</a>.

<UL>

<LI> You can learn about the Random Writer assignment by reading this
<a href="handout.html">example handout<a>.

<P>

<LI> Here are the <a href="RandomWriter.ppt">powerpoint slides</a>
that I presented at SIGCSE, and here is an <a
href="RandomWriter.html">HTML version of the slides</a>.

<P>

<LI> If you download this <a href="RandomWriter.jar">executable jar
file</a>, you can both run the Random Writer and extract the source
files that it contains.  You can, for example, run the Random Writer
on a seed length of 5, an output file length of 500, an input file
called "sawyer.txt", and an output file called "result.txt" by issuing
the command

<PRE>
java -jar RandomWriter.jar 5 500 sawyer.txt result.txt
</PRE>

from the command line.  You can extract the two source files with a
zip utility or by issuing the command

<PRE>
jar -xf RandomWriter.jar RandomWriter.java CharGenerator.java
</PRE>

from the command line.

I have used this assignment with great success in my CS 2 classes.  The
assignment is nifty for at least three reasons.

<OL>

<LI> When the problem is first presented to the students, it
sounds extremely difficult.  However, when they understand the
algorithm that I have in mind, they are impressed with how
straightforward it is.

<P>

<LI> When the students complete the Random Writer they have a lot of
fun playing with it.  I always run a contest to see who can generate
the funniest output.

<P>

<LI> The Random Writer is not a toy program; it can process the text
of entire books.

</OL>

<P>

The assignment touches on file input/output, string searching, the use
of a dynamic linear structure (such as Java ArrayLists), and the use
of randomly-generated integers.  When assigned in Java, the students
need to understand the portions of the Java API (java.lang.String,
java.lang.StringBuffer, java.util.Random, java.util.ArrayList,
java.io.FileReader, and java.io.FileWriter) that it exploits.  The
assignment typically takes one week.

<P>

One of the students who completed the assignment the first time I gave
it used the idea behind the Random Writer to devise a new technique
for synthesizing texture patterns in computer graphics applications <a
href="#efros">[2]</a>.  Rather than growing a text string one
character at a time, he grows texture patterns one pixel at a time.
