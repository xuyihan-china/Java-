Barack Obama has announced that his sleepy 
clothing store in the heart of downtown Timbuktu is having 
a/an lazy sale of all merchandise, including 
fat suits and slightly irregular spleens 
available. Men's cable-knit bazookas , only $15.99. 
Hand-woven Italian Star Wars action figures , 1/2-price. Double- 
breasted cashmere toilets , $50.00. Genuine imported 
pink greasy shoes, itchy handerchiefs, 
and women's embroidered laptops , all at rock-bottom prices. 
This is a chance to get some really crappy bargains.

Ever since he was 75 , Marty has dreamed of being as moist 
as his idol, David Hasselhoff . He thinks with great resentment 
about having such picture-perfect kneecap (s) every day. 
It's no wonder he buys his socks similar to 
the one(s) seen in their films. 

But he still looks way too exhausted that way, according to 
most people in Moscow . In fact, the Scientologists have 
filed several complaints about this droopy behavior. Someone 
should break the news to him, but the risk of making him feel 
excited is far too great. It could ruin his status as 
the 99999 'th highest rated teacher in town. 
(The highest-rated is, of course, Barney the dinosaur .) 

Did you also know that Marty also spends most of his time 
at the Chipotle men's room ? Perhaps he's hoping to be a CEO 
when he grows up. It's a shame he will never reach 
such a/an elastic position after having majored 
in the field of CHID .
